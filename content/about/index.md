Hi, I'm Will!

I'm an engineer living in Auckland. I write about programming and machine learning, mostly.

Things I've done (so far):

- Helped develop a [rocket engine and send a satellite to the moon](https://www.youtube.com/live/LtvMiivrxxA?si=-F8PH2Z62zVpUlsi&t=1930)
- Lead the analysis of several propellant systems for the [reusable Neutron rocket](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/launch/neutron/)
- Lead the development and early testing of Neutron's [RCS system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system)
- Developed internal tools for modelling, data analysis, and configuration management at [Rocket Lab](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/)
- Taught myself Rust (and accidentally learnt JavaScript and Svelte along the way) to develop [playhexchess.com](https://www.playhexchess.com)
