Hi, I'm Will!

I'm an engineer living in Auckland. I have a Master's in Mechanical and Aerospace engineering, 
but I write about programming and machine learning, mostly.

Things I've done (so far):

- Helped develop a *[rocket engine and send a satellite to the moon.](https://www.youtube.com/live/LtvMiivrxxA?si=-F8PH2Z62zVpUlsi&t=1930)*
- Lead the analysis of several propellant systems for the [reusable Neutron rocket.](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/launch/neutron/)
- Lead the development and early testing of Neutron's [RCS system.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system)
- Developed internal tools for modelling, data analysis, and configuration management at [Rocket Lab.](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/)
- Learnt Rust (and accidentally learnt JavaScript and some web-dev along the way) by developing **[playhexchess.com](https://www.playhexchess.com)**
