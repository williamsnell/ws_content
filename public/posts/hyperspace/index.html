<p>Hyperspace might seem exotic - and it is - but learning better ways to explore it can be both useful
and (dare I say) fun.</p>
<p>Spaces with dimensionality higher than 3 or 4 might be outside of our lived experience, but
that doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t exist, or that they can&rsquo;t be useful.
For example, hyperspaces frequently shows up in neural networks. By
learning to explore hyperspace, we can try gain a better understanding
of how they work.</p>
<p>The motivating
example for this article comes from the sub-field of <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/gan">Generative Adversarial Networks</a>.</p>
<p>The following portraits were generated by StyleGAN2 <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch">(Karras, et. al)</a>:</p>

<p>To dramatically oversimplify, these neural networks take an input vector,
do some transformations on it, and produce an image. The input vector
is typically random noise, and the vector is often quite long - hundreds or thousands of elements long.</p>
<p>These vectors make up the <strong>latent space</strong> of the model. Because these
vectors are long, the latent space is high dimensional.
Manipulating the outputs of these models relies on us
being able to chart paths through their latent space.</p>
<p>For example, if we want to smoothly blend from the first painting above to the second,
we need a way to traverse from the vector representing one image
to the vector representing the other.</p>

<p>To get from point A to point B, the obvious answer is to go in as straight a
line as possible. The simplest answer here is also the shortest.
Indeed, when working with latent spaces, going in a straight line does generally work,
with varying degrees of success. This is known as linear interpolation (lerp), and
would be written something like this:</p>

<p>While exploring this topic, I came across a <a href="https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch/issues/14">befuddling thread</a>
which suggested that the best path was <strong>not, in fact, a straight line</strong>. Rather, a function called
<code>slerp</code>, or &ldquo;spherical linear interpolation&rdquo;, was suggested. This has the rather complicated
functional form:</p>

this:</p>
<div id="3d_slerp"></div>
<script>
spawn_plot("3d_slerp", (div_id) => {
let redraw_3d_slerp = get_interpolated_chart(vec_space_1000, div_id, slerp, demo_start, demo_stop,
                                          identity_transform);
redraw_3d_slerp(3, 0, identity_transform);
});
</script>
<p>When thinking about what a &ldquo;good&rdquo; interpolation path might look like, a few
different ideas come to mind. We want it to be:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Smooth</em> - in my experience, jagged, jerky paths do not work well
for blending between two latent vectors.</li>
<li><em>Relatively short</em>, since we care about capturing the changes
between two specific points, rather than going sightseeing
to irrelevant destinations</li>
<li><em>Well-trodden</em> - We&rsquo;ve trained our neural net on a limited set of data.
If our interpolation takes us far outside anything the neural net
has ever seen, it&rsquo;s unlikely to perform well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at slerp, we can see:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is <em>smooth</em></li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t look particularly short. In fact, it&rsquo;s much <em>longer</em>
than our straight-line path.</li>
<li>It doesn&rsquo;t seem to stick particularly closely to the data we&rsquo;ve
trained the network on. In fact, it sometimes goes <strong>outside
of our (-1, 1) domain</strong> entirely!</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2D and 3D space, linear interpolation simply doesn&rsquo;t have the issues
that slerp does. <strong>Yet, slerp is consistently recommended.</strong></p>
<p>Clearly, something about hyperspace behaves very non-intuitively!</p>
<p>Strap in&hellip; because it&rsquo;s time to go exploring.</p>
<h1 id="windows-into-hyperspace">Windows into Hyperspace<a href="#windows-into-hyperspace" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the concept of vectors.</p>
<p>A vector is just a collection of numbers,
arranged in a single column or row, like so:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v}_{3} = \begin{bmatrix}
        1.9 \\
        4.7 \\
        -3.1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<p>An n-dimensional vector is \(n\) items long:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v}_{n} = \begin{bmatrix}
        x_{1} \\
        \vdots \\
        x_{n}
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<p>Vectors can be used to represent all sorts of things, but here we&rsquo;re
going to use them to represent <em>cartesian coordinates</em>.</p>
<h2 id="1-space">1-space<a href="#1-space" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>If we had only 1 spatial dimension to play with, we could represent every
possible position with a 1-dimensional vector:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v}_{1} = \begin{bmatrix}
        x_{1} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<p>If we were to fill our space with lots of random points, uniformly
distributed from -1 to 1, it would look like this:</p>
<div id="1d_space_chart" class="plotly"></div>
<script>
const vec_space = rand(1000, 1);
spawn_plot("1d_space_chart", (div_id) => {
    get_2d_chart(vec_space, div_id, 0, ["", "", ""]);
});
</script>
<p>Hopefully, this result is pretty unsurprising.</p>
<h2 id="2-space">2-space<a href="#2-space" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>If we extend our vectors into two dimensions, and perform the same exercise, we&rsquo;ll get
something like this:</p>
<div id="2d_space_chart" class="plotly"></div>
<script>
const vec_space_2 = rand(1_000, 2);
spawn_plot("2d_space_chart", (div_id) => {
    get_2d_chart(vec_space_2, div_id, 0, ["", "", ""]);
});
</script>
<p>For every possible location in this space, we can
define an exact point through something like:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v}_{2} = \begin{bmatrix}
        -0.85 \\
        0.24 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<h2 id="3-space">3-space<a href="#3-space" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Extending up to 3D is quite straightforward, where we
now have 3-long vectors like this:</p>
<div id="3_vec">
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v}_{3} = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.26 \\
        -0.88 \\
        -0.9 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
</div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s again scatter some points uniformly between -1 and 1,
this time in 3 dimensions:</p>
<div id="3d_space_chart" style="width: 100%;"></div>
<script>
const vec_space_3 = rand(10_000, 3);
spawn_plot("3d_space_chart", (div_id) => {
    get_3d_chart(vec_space_3, div_id, 0, ["", "", ""]);
});
</script>
<p>We&rsquo;re very used to looking at 3D space through these kinds of visualizations, where
our brain can reconstruct a series of 2D images into a 3D representation.</p>
<h2 id="flattening-space">Flattening Space<a href="#flattening-space" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>What if we wanted to look at <strong>this 4D</strong> vector
inside its vector space:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v}_{4} = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.93  \\
        -0.43 \\
        0.67  \\
        0.12  \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<p>We could <em>try</em> using time as an extra dimension,
but we&rsquo;ve already run out of spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>Of course, we want to go far beyond a mere <em>four</em> dimensions.
Even if we used time, how would we visualize something like this?</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v}_{1000} = \begin{bmatrix}
        x_{1}      \\
        x_{2}      \\
        \vdots     \\
        x_{1000}   \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<h2 id="projecting">Projecting<a href="#projecting" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>To glimpse higher dimensions, we&rsquo;re
necessarily going to need to make compromises.
With <em>up to</em> 3 dimensions to play with, any given
viewport will need to choose what information to show and what to hide.</p>
<p>A natural way to project higher dimensions is to just take
the first \(n\) dimensions we can display, and ignore the rest.</p>
<p>We can visualize what this looks like by creating a vector space
in three dimensions, and visualizing it with two.</p>
<p>If we want to display the vector:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.21   \\
        -0.85  \\
        -0.32  \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<p>We can display the first 2 elements, i.e.:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{c}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.21  \\
        -0.85 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<p>Where \(\vec{c}_2\) represents a <strong>cartesian projection</strong>
down to 2 dimensions.</p>
<p>We can write this as an equation:</p>
\[
    \vec{v}_3 \mapsto \vec{c}_2
\]
<p>Where the arrow \(\mapsto\) means
&ldquo;maps to&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Visualized, it looks like so:</p>
<div id="3d_into_2d" style="width: 100%;"></div>
<script>
spawn_plot("3d_into_2d", (div_id) => {
    get_2d_3d_chart(vec_space_3, div_id);
});
</script>
<p>We can pick any 2 elements to display, of course.
Representing our 3-space in 2 dimensions could
be done equally validly by picking two different
elements, such as the last element \(x_{3}\)
and the second element \(x_{2}\):</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
        -0.32 \\
        -0.85 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<p>What does our 2D projection tell us about the 3D space?
Well, we effectively get the same view as if we rotated
our 3D view until we were just looking at one face.</p>
<p>If we&rsquo;re plotting, say, \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\),
we get a perfect understanding of how our points are
distributed in those two dimensions.</p>
<p>Should we want to know
what portion of points have \(x_{1}\) &gt; 0
and \(x_{2}\) &lt; 0, we can
look at the 2D chart and easily see the answer is
~25%.</p>
<p>However, we get absolutely no information about the
rest of our vector. It wouldn&rsquo;t matter if we were
plotting a vector of length 3 or a vector of length
3000 - from this viewpoint, they all look the same.</p>
<h2 id="different-projections">Different Projections<a href="#different-projections" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve been exploring space with <em>cartesian</em> coordinates.</p>
<p>Without completely justifying it, I&rsquo;m going to introduce
a completely different coordinate system - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system">spherical coordinates</a>.</p>
<p>Most people are used to &ldquo;cartesian&rdquo; coordinates. In the following
image, it seems natural to define the position of the red cross based
on two distances, which we typically call x and y.
<img src="xy.svg"></p>
<p>We could represent this point as a vector:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
        x \\
        y \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<p>In higher dimensions, we can add more directions, provided they are
perpendicular to all the other directions. Hence, for 3d, we might
use (x, y, z).</p>
<p>In a spherical coordinate system, however, a point in space is defined
not by \(n\) orthogonal coordinates (e.g. x, y, and z), but rather
as a <em>radial distance</em> \(r\), and then a series of angles.</p>
<p>To fully describe any point in 2D-space, we need two coordinates.
Since we already have one (the distance from the origin \(r\)),
we need one more. Hence, a 2D spherical coordinate system would have
one angle, \(\theta_1\).</p>
<img src="radial.svg">
<p>We can also represent this point as a vector:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{s}_2 = \begin{bmatrix}
        r          \\
        \theta_{1} \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]
<p>Notice that <strong>both \(\vec{v}_2\) and \(\vec{s}_2\)</strong> refer to
the exact same point in space. The actual numbers inside the vectors,
and the coordinate <strong>system</strong> used are very different, but the point
in space is the same.</p>
<h3 id="adding-dimensions">Adding Dimensions<a href="#adding-dimensions" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>In 3-space, we need a third coordinate. For cartesian coordinates, we add z
to our existing x and y. For spherical coordinates, we add
another angle \(\theta_2\).</p>
<p>These two vectors represent the same position:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
        0.54  \\
        -0.87 \\
        0.26  \\
    \end{bmatrix}_{[x,y,z]}
    = \vec{s} = \begin{bmatrix}
        1.06  \\
        -1.02 \\
        1.32  \\
    \end{bmatrix}_{[r, \theta_1, \theta_2]}
\end{align}
\]
<h3 id="why-bother-with-spherical-coordinates">Why bother with spherical coordinates?<a href="#why-bother-with-spherical-coordinates" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>How does this help us? After all, you still
need an n-length vector to represent a point in n-space.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting, however, is when you start looking at
higher dimensions. Since the length \(r\) takes into account
the entire vector, plotting the first 2 or 3 elements in the
spherical vector gives us a different view on higher dimensions.</p>
<p>Importantly, <strong>we always keep the magnitude of the full vector</strong>
when using spherical coordinates.</p>
<p>We then get to select 1 angle (for a 2D plot) or 2 angles (for
a 3D plot). These angles represent the relative positioning
between <strong>some, but not all</strong> elements of the vector.</p>
<p><a href="/posts/hyperspace/#projecting">Earlier, we projected higher-dimensional space</a> into 2D and 3D
cartesian plots. We got to pick 2 elements from our larger vector, and had to
throw away the rest.</p>
<p>We have to do a similar thing in spherical coordinates. However, we <em>always</em>
keep the magnitude. This means that we&rsquo;re left with the ability to pick
one angle (for a 2d plot) or 2 angles (for a 3d plot) from our larger
vector.</p>

<p>Our projection has shown us an unintuitive, but true, fact about
hyperspace - as the dimensionality increases, our points converge
to a hyperspherical shell. The radius of this shell scales with
the square root of our initial distribution&rsquo;s variance, \(\sqrt{\sigma^2} = \sigma\),
and with the square root of our dimensionality, \(\sqrt{n}\).</p>
<p>The exact formula for the radius varies depending on the type of
noise used (results for a <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/317095/expectation-of-square-root-of-sum-of-independent-squared-uniform-random-variable/317475#317475">uniform distribution</a>
and this <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/09/01/multivariate-normal-shell/">great post with results for normal distributions</a>).</p>
<p>For both uniform and normal distributions, the hyperspherical
shell has a relatively constant thickness as the dimensionality
increases, leading to an increasingly shell-like distribution of points.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-this-mean">What does this mean?<a href="#what-does-this-mean" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>In lower dimension spaces (2D, 3D, etc.) the radius of our hypershell
is of the same order as the variance of the distribution. This means
that, in general, there isn&rsquo;t much of a &ldquo;hole&rdquo; at the origin. However,
even in 3D (using our 2D plot), we start to see a gap open up near the
origin.</p>
<p>Below are two expandable sections with different ways to interpret the
existence of a hyperspherical shell.</p>
<hr>
<details>
    <summary>Geometric Interpretation</summary>
<p>As explained in <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/09/01/multivariate-normal-shell/">John D. Cook&rsquo;s post</a>,
volume <strong>grows faster</strong> in higher dimensions.
For our uniform distribution, our probability density is constant between its bounds of (-1, 1),
and so we can pretty much ignore it.</p>
<p>Volume, however, is proportional to \(r^n\), where \(r\) is the distance
from the origin and \(n\) is the dimensionality of our space.
If \(n = 1000\) dimensions, the difference between a sphere of radius
0.999 and radius 1.000 is</p>
\[
1.000^{1000} - 0.99^{1000} \approx 0.9999
\]
<p>In other words, &gt;99% of all of our volume is contained in an outer shell, with
thickness of 1% the radius of our space.
The reason this collosal growth of volume with radius is not intuitive, is because
in 3D, the same calculation would give around 3% of the volume in the outermost
shell of our sphere:</p>
\[
1.000^3 - 0.99^3 \approx 0.03 
\]
<p>Hence, even though our probability density function is constant in space,
when we go to higher dimensions, <strong>the amount of space near the origin is astronomically
low, and the amount at the outer perimeter is astronomically high.</strong></p>
<p>Because so much space is so far out, our points will inevitably &ldquo;cluster&rdquo;
there.</p>
</details>
<details>
    <summary>Statistical Interpretation</summary>
<p>We can also think about this result statistically.</p>
<p>All the elements in our vectors are independent and identically distributed.
The more elements we have, the more we will expect to see strong statistical
trends in the overall properties of our vector, even while individual
elements remain random.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine we&rsquo;re rolling a fair die, with sides labelled 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
The expected value of our roll is 2.5, but we wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised with a 0
or a 5.</p>
<p>If we now roll 2 dice, make a graph, and plot our first roll on the x axis
and our second on the y axis, we again get a fairly even distribution.</p>
<p>However, if we instead added the total of our two dice together, we
would be looking at a score between 0 and 10, with 5 being our expected value.
Already, our sum is starting to cluster, with 5 much more likely than
either 0 or 10.</p>
<p>The more dice we roll:</p>
<ol>
<li>The bigger we expect our total score to be, and</li>
<li>The less and less likely we are to have a sum near 0 (or near the absolute
highest possible score of \(5 \times n\) rolls.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The same process, roughly, is going on with the magnitude of our vectors.
Instead of just summing our rolls, we&rsquo;re squaring each roll, summing the
squares, and then taking the square root. These functions warp and
compress space a bit, but our intuition should generally still hold.</p>
<p>We should intuitively expect that the more dice we roll,</p>
<ol>
<li>The bigger our square-root sum of squares is, and</li>
<li>The less and less likely we are to have a point near the origin
(or in the corners of our hypercube.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Hopefully, you now have a solid grip on the spherical projections
we&rsquo;ll be using from this point onwards. Remember, the distance
from a point to the origin in each plot represents the vector magnitude of
the <em>full vector</em>.</p>
<p>Under this lens, what does linear interpolation (our <code>lerp</code> function from earlier)
look like?</p>
<div id="spherical_lerp"></div>
<div id="lerp_vec"></div>
<script>
spawn_plot_with_vector("spherical_lerp", "lerp_vec",
    (plot_id, vec_id) => {
        let redraw_chart = get_interpolated_chart(vec_space_1000, plot_id, lerp, vec_space_1000[0], vec_space_1000[1],
                                              vecs_to_spherical);
        let widget2 = get_vector_widget(vec_space_1000[0], vec_id, redraw_chart, 1);
        },
);
</script>
<p>At low dimensions, lerp behaves exactly how we expect it to. But by the time we reach
around 20 dimensions, there&rsquo;s a clear problem. Our linear path is well outside
the bounds of all the points in our vector space.</p>
<p>As we increase the dimensionality of our space, the problem gets worse. At 1000 dimensions,
lerp spends almost the entirety of its path completely outside of the hyperspherical shell
that makes up the points in our vector space.</p>
<p>In a machine learning context, this would mean that the interpolation is feeding in data
well outside the bounds of anything the model has been trained on.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-lerp-behave-like-this-in-higher-dimensional-spaces">Why Does Lerp Behave Like This in Higher Dimensional Spaces?<a href="#why-does-lerp-behave-like-this-in-higher-dimensional-spaces" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>To understand why <code>lerp</code> diverges from our hyperspherical shell in higher
dimensions, we have to think about what it&rsquo;s doing. For each element \(x_i\) in \(\vec{v}^1\)
and \(y_i\) in \(\vec{v}^2\), the output of <code>lerp</code> can
never be larger than \(\max(x_i, y_i)\) and can never
be smaller than \(\min(x_i, y_i)\). Unless \(x_i\) and \(y_i\) both happen
to fall at exact opposite ends of their distributions, <code>lerp</code> will necessarily
be operating in a smaller domain.</p>
<p>Right at the midpoint, where <code>fraction=0.5</code>, <code>lerp</code> will give a vector that is
the average of \(vec{v}^1\) and \(\vec{v}^2\). The average is the point where
all values will be the most &ldquo;smoothed out&rdquo;. Because a particularly large element
is equally likely to appear in \(\vec{v}^1\) or \(\vec{v}^2\), averaging the two
vectors should give the point in the interpolation with minimum variance.
Because the distributions are centred about 0, minium variance corresponds to
minimum distance from the origin.</p>
<p>If you want to try visualize this, change the <code>lerp</code> visualization <a href="/posts/hyperspace/#tracing-lines-through-hyperspace">here</a>
to have 3 dimensions. Imagine connecting any two points in the space with a
straight line. For every pair of points, the midpoint of a straight line
connecting them is closer to the origin than either point.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the fact that lerp averages between the two vectors means that
the distribution of the vector becomes less and less uniform the closer to <code>fraction=0.5</code>
we get. But that&rsquo;s a topic for another post.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-slerp-actually-doing">What Is Slerp Actually Doing?<a href="#what-is-slerp-actually-doing" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Remember the definition of the slerp function <a href="/posts/hyperspace/#the-obvious-answer-is-wrong">from earlier?</a>
Let&rsquo;s break down where it came from, and what it&rsquo;s actually doing.</p>
<p>By looking at the projections above, you hopefully have a good intuition for
<em>what</em> slerp is doing. The hints are in its name - spherical linear interpolation.
The function works by <strong>rotating</strong> about the origin. Instead of translating from
point A to point B, slerp rotates between the two points, and scales the magnitude
of the vector while doing so.</p>
<p>As our spherical coordinate projections <a href="/posts/hyperspace/#why-bother-with-spherical-coordinates">above showed,</a>
higher dimensional spaces converge to a hyperspherical shell. To stay in this shell, we
want to orbit around the origin, keeping the vector magnitude (approximately) constant. This
is what slerp does, or tries to do.</p>
<p>To actually get to the code, we have two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rotating in hyperspace.</li>
<li>Scaling between the two vectors&rsquo; magnitudes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Part 1) is provided to us by Shoemake &amp; Davis, in the paper
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/325334.325242">Animating Rotation with Quaternion Curves</a>.
In it, a rotation between two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjMuIxRvygQ">quaternions</a>,
\(q_1\) and \(q_2\), is given by the formula:</p>
\[
    \text{Slerp}(q_1, q_2; u) = \frac{\sin( (1 - u)\omega)}{\sin \omega} q_1 + \frac{\sin u\omega}{\sin \omega} q_2
\]
<p>Where \(u\) is the <code>fraction</code> parameter between 0 and 1, and \(q_1 \cdot q_2 = \cos \omega\).</p>
<p>It turns out that this equation generalizes to n-dimensional vectors. Hence, we have part 1): a function to
rotate from one vector to another. I&rsquo;m unclear how &ldquo;optimal&rdquo; this rotation is, since there are many ways to
rotate between two vectors in hyperspace. However, rotation - or &ldquo;distance preserving linear maps&rdquo; - are
very complicated and dimension-specific, so sticking with a general formula that works is a good plan.</p>
<p>If we recall the definition of the dot product of two vectors:</p>
\[
    a \cdot b = \vert \vert a \vert \vert  \space  \vert \vert b \vert \vert \cos \omega
\]
<p>Where \(\omega\) is the angle between the two vectors. We need \(\omega\) for our
slerp formula. So, we can rewrite the formula as:</p>
\[
    \omega = \arccos( \frac{a}{\vert\vert a \vert \vert} \cdot \frac{b}{\vert \vert b \vert \vert} )
\]
<p>Another way of thinking about \(\frac{a}{\vert \vert a \vert \vert}\) is that is this is \(\hat{a}\)
(pronounced a-hat) - the unit (length 1) vector which represents only the direction components of a.</p>
<p>This is indeed what the python slerp function does:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>When the magnitudes of the two vectors are not particularly close,
such as in lower dimensions, this formula can give quite strange
results. This is exacerbated where the vectors are (almost) pi radians
apart from one another. (Since the vector spaces on this page are randomly
generated, if you refresh a few times, you&rsquo;re bound to see some strange
slerp results in lower dimensions.)</p>
<p>A slight improvement can be had by explicitly treating the interpolation between
the two vectors&rsquo; magnitudes, and normalizing the vectors before performing the
slerp. This results in visually smoother paths,
and tends to overshoot the data bounds less when there are large changes in vector
magnitude.</p>
<p>We treat the vector magnitude explicitly, and just linearly interpolate (<code>lerp</code>) between
the magnitude of the first vector and the magnitude of the second vector. For the
purposes of this article, and at risk of being conceited, I&rsquo;ll call this function <code>slerp2</code>.
It is moderately more complicated than <code>slerp</code>. The implementation here is formatted for
readability, not performance.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all well and good talking abstractly of hyperspheres, but
you&rsquo;re probably wondering: does <code>slerp</code> actually perform better
in real-world applications?</p>
<p>At the start of this post, I wrote about <code>StyleGAN</code>. I picked it
because it is a more modern network building on the principals of
other GANs like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434v2">DCGAN</a>. DCGAN,
you might remember, is where the thread on <code>slerp</code> originated that
kicked off this whole journey.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to <em>just</em> explore DCGAN, where there are <a href="https://github.com/Newmu/dcgan_code/issues/12">known dead zones
near the origin of the latent space</a>.
Instead, I wanted to explore whether this is still the case with newer
networks.</p>
<p><code>StyleGAN</code> actually has <strong>two</strong> latent spaces to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>Z-space, which is sampled from a normal distribution with 512 dimensions.</li>
<li>W-space, which is internal to the network itself and is the result of
<em>learned</em> transformations on the Z-space vectors.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll probably explore W-space in the future, but for now, Z-space
matches the kind of latent spaces we&rsquo;ve been exploring in this article,
so that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll explore.</p>
<h2 id="degenerate-case-1-almost-passing-through-the-origin">Degenerate Case 1: (Almost) passing through the origin<a href="#degenerate-case-1-almost-passing-through-the-origin" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I have a secret to confess: the two portraits I presented at the start of
this article were not exactly <em>randomly</em> picked. The second portrait is
an (almost) exact opposite of the first - that is, the vector \(\vec{v}^2\)
used to generate the second image was calculated as:</p>
\[
    \vec{v}^2 = - \vec{v}^1 + \epsilon
\]
<p>Where \(\epsilon\) was a very small offset necessary to prevent <code>slerp</code> and <code>slerp2</code> from blowing
up with a \(\frac{1}{\sin(0)}\) term. \(\vec{v}^1\) was a random vector
from the correct distribution.</p>
<p>This means our <code>lerp</code> from the first portrait to the second is a straight
line (nearly) through the origin.</p>
<p>This is a degenerate case which should show whether vector magnitude actually
matters. Play around with the slider below to see the results for yourself.</p>
<div id="through_origin"></div>
<script>
let stylegan_space = randn(1000, 512);
let interp_points = [0.00, 0.14, 0.29, 0.43, 0.57, 0.71, 0.86, 1.00];
fetch("vecs.json")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(jvecs => {
    start_through_origin = jvecs.z;
    stop_through_origin = add(mult(jvecs.z, -1), 1e-4);
    spawn_plot("through_origin",
        (div_id) => {
            let redraw = get_multi_interp_chart(stylegan_space, div_id, {lerp: lerp, slerp: slerp, slerp2: slerp2}, start_through_origin, stop_through_origin, 
                                        "./near_origin", interp_points,
                                        vecs_to_spherical);
        });
    });
</script>
<p>You can see that the image generated by the <code>lerp</code>-ed vector doesn&rsquo;t meaningfully change
until passing the origin, where it immediately changes to the output image. This is interesting,
and might suggest that for StyleGAN2:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vector magnitude is unimportant, in comparison to vector direction.</li>
<li>The learned transformations between Z-space and W-space might discard
magnitude information, or else are only sensitive to magnitude within the
tight range for which all input data (in Z-space) was provided.</li>
</ul>

<p>This second degenerate case is similar to the first, excepting a slight
change in vector magnitude between \(\vec{v}^1\) and \(\vec{v}^2\). In this case,
I multiplied \(\vec{v}^1\) by 0.9999 and \(\vec{v}^2\) by 1.0001. This was to
see if vector magnitude had an impact on the images produced, and whether
<code>slerp</code> or <code>slerp2</code> handled it better.</p>
<div id="through_origin_with_scale"></div>
<script>
fetch("vecs.json")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(jvecs => {
    start_scale = mult(jvecs.z, 0.9999);
    stop_scale = add(mult(jvecs.z, -1.0001), 1e-4);
    spawn_plot("through_origin_with_scale",
        (div_id) => {
            let redraw_scale = get_multi_interp_chart(stylegan_space, div_id, {lerp: lerp, slerp: slerp, slerp2: slerp2}, 
                                                start_scale, stop_scale, "./near_origin_scale", 
                                                interp_points, vecs_to_spherical);
        });
    });
</script>
<p>This case exacerbates an odd quirk of <code>slerp</code> - when vector magnitudes are relatively
different (and when angles are relatively aligned), the interpolation can produce
truly bizarre paths. This is a little unfair on regular <code>slerp</code>, though, since this case
will statistically never be seen when interpolating between two random vectors.</p>
<p><code>slerp2</code> performs best here, presumably because it most evenly sweeps between angles
from start to finish. But all three interpolators are producing meaningful results.
This is really a testament to the robustness of StyleGAN.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s only fair to compare interpolation between two actually random vectors,
and that&rsquo;s exactly what&rsquo;s going on here.</p>
<div id="random"></div>
<script>
fetch("vecs.json")
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(jvecs => {
    start_scale = jvecs.random_start;
    stop_scale = jvecs.random_stop;
    spawn_plot("random", 
        (div_id) => {
            let redraw_scale = get_multi_interp_chart(stylegan_space, div_id, 
                                                        {lerp: lerp, slerp: slerp, slerp2: slerp2}, 
                                                        start_scale, stop_scale, "./random", 
                                                        interp_points, vecs_to_spherical);
        }
    );
    }
);
</script>
<p>You&rsquo;ll note that even though <code>lerp</code> shows its characteristically out-of-family
vector magnitude, the results produced by all 3 interpolators are functionally
identical.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>As <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf">Pedro Domingos famously put it</a>,
<em>Intuition Fails in High Dimensions</em>. Before setting out on this journey, I didn&rsquo;t expect
higher dimensional vectors to form hyperspherical shells, nor did I expect spherical interpolation
to be a better way of interpolating between two such vectors.</p>
<p>When all is said and done, though, the importance of how one navigates in hyperspace may
not matter, and certainly depends on the actual system being studied.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the best solution really is the simplest one.</p>
