<p>In this post, we will explore how, and why, to
project from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space and back.</p>
<p>For the first section, we will play with some simple models intended to build an intuition
for what is and isn&rsquo;t possible with these projections. We&rsquo;ll also build some techniques
for analysing these <em>subspaces</em>, and comparing different <em>subspaces</em>.</p>
<p>In the second section, we will dive into how, and why, we can apply this to machine learning,
and in particular to the transformer architecture. For this section, I&rsquo;d recommend reading
<a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html">A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits</a>.
In particular, understanding the transformer architecture, and the idea of <strong>composition</strong> between
heads.</p>
<p>I was inspired to write this post after reading <em>A Mathematical Framework</em> and wondering if
there was a way to get a more granular understanding of attention head composition. Beyond just
asking if heads composed, I wanted to try quantify the effective &ldquo;bandwidth&rdquo; between two heads. This
post summarizes that work, which was somewhat successful.</p>
<h1 id="part-1-geometry-and-intuition">Part 1: Geometry and Intuition<a href="#part-1-geometry-and-intuition" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>To understand communication between attention heads, we need to understand projection.
We will start out with low-dimensional examples, which we can visualize, to help build our intuition.
A lot of this will carry over to higher dimensions, which we cannot fully visualize.</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-projection-2d---1d">A simple projection (2D -&gt; 1D)<a href="#a-simple-projection-2d---1d" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>To explain what we mean by projection, imagine we have a 2D space.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll call a vector living in this space \(\vec{x}\), and it will look like:</p>
\[
    \begin{align}
        \vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix} 
                x_0 \\
                x_1 \\
                  \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align}
\]<p>Here, \(x_0\) and \(x_1\) are just numbers. E.g. an element of our 2D space could be:</p>
\[
    \begin{align}
        \vec{x} = \begin{bmatrix}
                    5.2   \\
                    -11.0 \\
                  \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align}
\]<p>We can define a matrix, \(W_{(2\rightarrow 1)}\), to project vectors from our 2D space into a new 1D space.
We&rsquo;ll call elements of this new 1D space \(\vec{y}\), and they will look like:</p>
\[
    \begin{align}
        \vec{y} = \begin{bmatrix}
                    y_0 \\
                  \end{bmatrix}
    \end{align}
\]<p>All our projections will be linear, meaning \(W_{(2 \rightarrow 1)}\) will not depend on the
values of \(\vec{x}\)</p>
<p>To make things a little less abstract, lets pick some values for \(W_{(2 \rightarrow 1)}\).
Any numbers will do, and these are picked somewhat arbitrarily.</p>
<p>\(W_{(2 \rightarrow 1)}\) will be a <em>1 x 2</em> matrix:
2 columns for the number going in, 1 row for the number coming out.</p>
\[
        \begin{align}
            W_{(2 \rightarrow 1)} = \begin{bmatrix}
                                    2 & -1 \\
                                  \end{bmatrix}
        \end{align}
\]<p>Our 1-dimensional vector \(\vec{y}\) is then simply:</p>
\[
                            \vec{y} = W_{(2 \rightarrow 1)} \: \vec{x}
\]<h4 id="projecting-down">Projecting Down<a href="#projecting-down" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>Let&rsquo;s throw a bunch of points in our 2D space, wiggling around randomly.
We&rsquo;ll then project them to our 1D space, and visualize what happens.</p>
<div id="plot1"></div>
<script>
two_d_to_one_d("plot1");

</script>
<p>[[[
Plot: 2D plot with wiggling points, 1D plot with wiggling points.</p>
<pre><code>\(W_{(2 \rightarrow 1)}\) modifiable.

Orient to line button.
</code></pre>
<p>]]]</p>
<p>A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The straight line in the 2D plot represents our matrix, \(W_{(2 \rightarrow 1)}\).</li>
<li>Change the values of \(W_{(2 \rightarrow 1)}\) and seeing how the line changes.</li>
<li>Try clicking the &ldquo;orient along line&rdquo; button, and then imagine collapsing the vertical
direction in the plot. You should see that this is equivalent (minus a scaling factor)
to the 1D plot.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully, I have convinced you that the following concepts are all equivalent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projecting a 2D point along a line.</li>
<li>Multiplying a <em>1 x 2</em> matrix with a 2D vector</li>
<li>Taking a weighted sum of components in 2D, i.e. \(y_0 = a \cdot x_0 + b \cdot x_1\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, you should see that by doing this projection, we have fundamentally
<strong>lost information</strong>. If this fact isn&rsquo;t obvious yet, that&rsquo;s ok - it&rsquo;ll become clear when
we project back up.</p>
<h4 id="projecting-up">Projecting Up<a href="#projecting-up" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>We&rsquo;ve seen that projecting down loses information, by collapsing our plane onto a line.
Does projecting up similarly expand a line into a plane?</p>
<p>No, it doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In fact, we&rsquo;ll see that projecting a 1D vector to higher dimensions simply means writing
to a line in that high-dimensional space. Since we&rsquo;re using constant matrices, that line
is always going to be straight. Hence, even though our up-projected vector <em>looks</em> 2-dimensional,
in some very real sense it is still squarely 1D.</p>
<p>To show this, let&rsquo;s define our up-projection matrix, \(W_{(1\rightarrow2)}\).
This will need to be of shape <em>2 x 1</em>: 1 column for the dimension going in, 2 rows
for the dimensions coming out. Again, the numbers in this matrix were picked arbitrarily.</p>
\[
\begin{align}
        W_{(1 \rightarrow 2)} = \begin{bmatrix}
                                -1.5 \\
                                3.2 \\
                                \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]<p>We&rsquo;ll continue calling our 1D vector \(\vec{y}\), and call the up-projection \(\vec{z}\).</p>
<p>Then, we have:</p>
\[
                        \vec{z} = W_{(1 \rightarrow 2)} \: \vec{y}
\]<p>Once again, play around with the values of \(W_{(1 \rightarrow 2)}\) and prove to yourself
that up-projecting is <strong>always</strong> going to write along a line in the higher-dimensional space.</p>
<p>It turns out that this fact generalizes into higher dimensions.</p>
<p>If we want to, we can combine a down-projection with an up-projection.</p>
<p>That is,</p>
\[
\begin{align}
                        \vec{z} &= W_{(1 \rightarrow 2)} \: \vec{y} \\
                        \vec{z} &= W_{(1 \rightarrow 2)} \: (W_{(2 \rightarrow 1)} \: \vec{x}) \\
                        \vec{z} &= (W_{(1 \rightarrow 2)} \: W_{(2 \rightarrow 1)}) \: \vec{x} \\
                        \vec{z} &= W_{(2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2)} \: \vec{x}
\end{align}
\]<p>Where \(W_{(2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2)}\) is a new matrix, of size <em>2 x 2</em>, created by multiplying
the existing up-projection and down-projection matrices together.</p>
<p>Because our matrix squeezes our 2D space through a 1D <strong>bottleneck</strong>,
it will have a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra)">rank</a> of 1</strong>, despite being <em>2 x 2</em>.</p>
<p>This is exactly equivalent to saying our matrix projects our higher dimensional space along a line,
scales it by some amount, and then projects it out along another line.</p>
<h2 id="aside-polarization">Aside: Polarization<a href="#aside-polarization" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Even with the very simple tools we&rsquo;ve developed, we can have some fun!</p>
<p>In some sense, a low-rank matrix <em>filters</em> or <em>polarizes</em> the space it reads in along a particular
direction. With very few assumptions, we can recreate a surprising fact from quantum mechanics!</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s make a down-projection matrix \(W_{down}\).
We&rsquo;ll fix the matrix elements to lie along the unit circle, with angle \(\theta\). This is the same as saying
we won&rsquo;t rescale our projection along the line.</p>
<p>That is,</p>
\[
\begin{align}
                W_{down} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        \cos{\theta} & \sin{\theta}
                            \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]<p>Here \(\theta\) gives us the angle of our line from the \(x_0\) direction.</p>
<p>Next, we just assume that our up-projection matrix \(W_{up}\) writes in the direction of the
same line that we just read from.</p>
\[
\begin{align} 
                W_{up} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        \cos{\theta} \\
                        \sin{\theta} \\
                        \end{bmatrix} 
\end{align}
\]<p>Our combined matrix \(W = W_{up} \: W_{down}\) is therefore:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
               W_{\theta} = \begin{bmatrix}
                    \cos^2{\theta} & \cos{\theta}\sin{\theta} \\
                    \cos{\theta}\sin{\theta} & \sin^2{\theta} \\
                   \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]<p>It turns out this is <strong>exactly</strong> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jones_calculus">Jones matrix</a> for
the polarization of light! We can see it in action below:</p>
<p>[[
Interactive, 2D -&gt; 2D, with theta adjustable
]]</p>
<p>In many ways, this is the simplest bottleneck projection we could do - it reads and writes along
the same direction, it doesn&rsquo;t rescale - and yet it already has some pretty wild emergent properties!</p>
<p>Take the <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Quantum_Tutorials_(Rioux)/07%3A_Quantum_Optics/7.13%3A_The_Three-Polarizer_Paradox">Three-Polarizer Paradox</a>:</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s place two polarizers, at angles 90Â° from one another - e.g. 0Â°, 90Â°.</p>
<p>The first polarizer cancels out any vertical component, leaving only horizontally polarized waves.
The second cancels out the horizontal component, leaving&hellip; nothing.
In real life, if we take two polarizing filters and place them 90Â° to
each other, we do in fact block all of the light.</p>
<p>We can see this in the maths:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
            W_{0Â°} &= \begin{bmatrix}
                        1 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 \\
                        \end{bmatrix} \\
            W_{90Â°} &= \begin{bmatrix}
                        0 & 0 \\
                        0 & 1 \\
                        \end{bmatrix} \\
            W_{90Â°} \: W_{0Â°} &= \begin{bmatrix}
                                        0 & 0 \\
                                        0 & 0 \\
                                \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]<p>However, lets try adding a 45Â° polarizer between the 0Â° and 90Â°:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
            W_{45Â°} &= \begin{bmatrix}
                        0.5 & 0.5 \\
                        0.5 & 0.5 \\
                      \end{bmatrix} \\
                        \\
                      \\
            W_{90Â°} W_{45Â°} W_{0Â°} &= \begin{bmatrix}
                       0 & 0 \\
                       0.5 & 0 \\
                       \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\]<p><strong>Light passes through!</strong></p>
<p>If you can find 3 pairs of polarized sunglasses, I&rsquo;d highly recommend trying this for yourself.</p>
<p>It can be fun to think of low-rank matrices as an abstract kind of polarizer. The difference,
of course, is that most of the time we&rsquo;re not writing out to the same exact space we read in from.</p>
<p>(Remember, saying a matrix is low-rank is exactly the same as saying we
map down to a bottleneck layer of lower dimension, and then map back up.)</p>
<h2 id="symmetry">Symmetry<a href="#symmetry" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>You might&rsquo;ve noticed that when we combine an up-projection matrix and a down-projection
matrix (e.g. \(W_{\theta}\) in the polarization example), the hidden layer effectively
disappears. We didn&rsquo;t <strong>need</strong> to explicitly write out the intermediate value of \(\vec{y}\),
like so:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
            \vec{z} &= W_{up} \: \vec{y} \\
            \vec{y} &= W_{down} \: \vec{x}
\end{align}
\]<p>Because nothing in the equations depends on the value of \vec{y},
we are free to fold it into the matrices. In some sense, the matrix
\(W_{up}\:W_{down}\) is more unique than the two sub-matrices individually.</p>
<p>We have a lot of freedom in how we slice and dice the combined matrix \(W_{ud} = W_{up}\:W_{down}\)
into two rectangular matrices.</p>
<p>Algebraically,</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    W_{ud} &= W_{up}\:W_{down} \\
           &= W_{up}\:A\;A^{-1}\:W_{down} \\ 
\end{align}
\]<p>Where \(A\) is any invertible matrix of shape \(d_{bottleneck} \times d_{bottleneck}\).</p>
<p>In this formulation, we would fold \(A\) into \(W_{up}\) and \(A^{-1}\) into \(W_{down}\),
and in doing so arbitrarily linearly transforming \(\vec{y}\):</p>
\[
\begin{align}
    \vec{z} &= (W_{up}\:A) \vec{y} \\
    \vec{y}&= (A^{-1}\:W_{down}) \vec{x} \\
\end{align}
\]<p>In some sense, we can say \(\vec{y}\) has a pretty extensive set of <em>symmetries</em>, whereby we can
arbitrarily rotate, scale, etc. the definition of \(\vec{y}\), without ever changing the overall
action performed by \(W_{ud}\). In my mind&rsquo;s eye, I imagine \(W_{ud}\) as a cube, and \(\vec{y}\) as
slicing that cube in half about some arbitrary axis. Regardless of how the first half of the cube is
sliced, the second half exactly cancels out that slice.</p>
<p>Most of these symmetries will be quite boring.</p>
<p>In a machine learning context, for example,
we should expect matrices of this type (e.g. the OV-circuit in a transformer) to represent a
randomly picked orientation in this huge group of symmetries. Because the model doesn&rsquo;t use \(\vec{y}\)
for anything, we should expect the \(\vec{y}\) we find in a real model to be randomly oriented. The
symmetries here mean no direction is special, and we shouldn&rsquo;t expect to find a privileged basis.</p>
<h4 id="symmetry-in-qk-circuits">Symmetry in QK circuits<a href="#symmetry-in-qk-circuits" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>A QK circuit is responsible for computing the <a href="https://transformerlensorg.github.io/CircuitsVis/?path=/docs/attention-attentionpattern--induction-head">attention pattern</a>
of the attention head, and
involves down-projecting the residual stream through two different matrices \(W_Q\) and \(W_K\),
before taking the dot product of these two vectors. This gives us the attention score, which is
then softmax&rsquo;d to get the attention pattern.</p>
<p>Writing this out, the attention score \(s\) is:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
                s &= \langle \vec{y_q}, \vec{y_k} \rangle \\
                  &= \langle W_K\:\vec{x}, W_Q\:\vec{x} \rangle \\
                  &= (W_K\:\vec{x})^T\:W_Q\:\vec{x} \\
                  &= \vec{x}^T\:W_K^T\:W_Q\:\vec{x} \\
\end{align}
\]<p>If we want to perform a basis in the bottleneck dimension,
and we add the restriction that we want to multiply both \(W_Q\) and \(W_K\) by the same
matrix \(A\), we get the following:</p>
\[
\begin{align}
                s &= (A\:W_K\:\vec{x})^T\:A\:W_Q\:\vec{x} \\
                  &= \vec{x}^T\:W_K^T\:A^T\:A\:W_Q\:\vec{x} \\
   \therefore A^T &= A^{-1}
\end{align}
\]<p>The matrices \(A\) that match this requirement are all part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_group">Orthogonal Group</a>
\(O(n)\). For example, if our bottleneck layer was 3-dimensional, we could use any matrix in \(O(3)\) to find
another basis. \(O(n)\) can be thought of as all possible flips, rotations, etc. we could perform in
n-dimensions. By definition, it preserves the inner product (in our case, the dot product), which
explains why we can use it for the attention score.</p>
<h3 id="symmetries-in-symmetries">Symmetries in Symmetries<a href="#symmetries-in-symmetries" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>Part of what makes neural nets like transformers so hard to interpret is that big components, like
the <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#residual-comms">residual stream</a>,
exhibit these symmetries. As explained in <strong>A Mathematical Framework</strong>, the residual stream is
just an arbitrary slice taken between the embedding and unembedding matrices. We could easily apply
a transformation to every matrix that reads from or writes to the residual stream, and the model
would be indistinguishable mathematically.</p>
<p>How then can we make any meaningful claims about different components which communicate through
the residual stream?</p>
