The challenge was to interpret how a simple neural net - in this case, a 1 layer 1 head transformer (with MLP) - solves a problem. The problem at hand was to predict the next token in a sequence of random tokens. As the model was trained with cross-entropy loss, training on a completely random dataset would lead the model to always uniformly predict all tokens in the vocabulary.

<p>Last week, I worked through the monthly Mechanistic Interpretability challenge from <a href="https://arena3-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/Monthly_Algorithmic_Problems">Callum McDougall&rsquo;s ARENA course</a>.</p>
<p><em>(A huge shoutout to Callum and the entire ARENA team for all the work they do!)</em></p>
<p>The challenge was to interpret how a simple neural net - in this case, a 1 layer 1 head transformer (with MLP) - solves a problem.
The problem at hand was to predict the next token in a sequence of random tokens. As the model was trained with cross-entropy
loss, training on a completely random dataset would lead the model to always uniformly predict all tokens in the vocabulary.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, inserted randomly throughout the dataset were <strong>trigrams</strong>, sequences of 3 tokens which always followed the pattern</p>
<p><code>trigram[0], trigram[1]</code> =&gt; <code>trigram[2].</code></p>
<p>For example, for a trigram <code>(1, 2, 3)</code> and the sequence <code>5 74 38 12 52 1 2</code>, we know for certain the next token is <code>3</code>.</p>
<p>Consequently, we expect the model to develop ways of detecting the presence of trigrams, determining <em>which</em> trigram is present, retrieving the correct completion, and writing to the output to confidently predict the correct completion token. The mechanisms the model learns to do this are explored below.</p>
<p>My work starts from <a href="/posts/interp_challenge_nov/trigrams_writeup/#Misc-Tools">&ldquo;Misc Tools&rdquo;</a> onwards. The <em>Setup</em>, <em>Task &amp; Dataset</em>, and <em>Model</em> sections are retained from the challenge post.</p>

<p>The problem for this month is interpreting a model which has been trained to predict the next token in an algorithmically generated sequence. Each sequence has tokens uniformly generated at random, except if the first 2 tokens of a particular trigram appear, in which case the next token is uniquely determined as the third token of the trigram. You can list all the trigrams with <code>dataset.trigrams</code>. Here&rsquo;s a demonstration:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>You can see how in this case <code>(2, 0, 5)</code> is one of the trigrams, and in both the 4th and 10th sequences above the tokens <code>(2, 5)</code> appear consecutively and so must be followed by <code>5</code>. Note that the trigrams are generated in a way to make them non-contradictory (i.e. we couldn&rsquo;t have <code>(2, 0, 5)</code> and <code>(2, 0, 6)</code> in our trigram set).</p>

<p>The model is <strong>not attention only</strong>. It has one attention layer with a single head, and one MLP layer. It does <em>not</em> have layernorm at the end of the model. It was trained with weight decay, and an AdamW optimizer with linearly decaying learning rate. You can load the model in as follows:</p>

<p>You can see from this heatmap that the model is managing to predict the correct token with probability around 100% in a small subset of cases (and you can examine the dataset to see that these are exactly the cases where the two preceding tokens form the start of one of the dataset&rsquo;s trigrams).</p>
<p>You can also see the Weights &amp; Biases run <a href="https://wandb.ai/callum-mcdougall/alg-challenge-trigrams-nov24/runs/c7jjsofv?nw=nwusercallummcdougall">here</a>. There are 5 important metrics that have been logged:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>train_loss</code>, which is the average cross entropy loss on the training set</li>
<li><code>train_loss_as_frac</code>, which is the loss scaled so that 1 is the loss you get when uniformly guessing over all tokens in the vocab, and 0 is the lowest possible loss (where the model has a uniform distribution everywhere except for the trigrams, where it has probability 1 on the correct token)</li>
<li><code>trigram_*</code>, which are three metrics specifically for the trigram dataset (i.e. the dataset consisting of only the dataset&rsquo;s special trigrams, i.e. the sequences <code>(a, b, c)</code> where <code>c</code> always directly follows <code>ab</code>). These metrics are only computed on the last token (i.e. the 3rd one) in each sequence. We have:
<ul>
<li><code>trigram_n_correct</code> = number of trigrams that were correctly predicted</li>
<li><code>trigram_frac_correct</code> = fraction of total trigrams that were correctly predicted</li>
<li><code>trigram_avg_correct_prob</code> = average probability assigned to the correct trigram token</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <code>trigram_frac_correct</code> is higher than <code>trigram_avg_correct_prob</code>, because some trigrams are predicted with slightly higher than uniform probability but still far from certainty. Also note that neither of these values has hit 100%, indicating that the model has learned most but not all of the trigrams. You can investigate these results for yourself when you inspect the model!</p>

<p>The first thing to probe is the attention head. To figure out what algorithm/s it might be implementing, we want to plot a number of different batches against the attention patterns.</p>
<p>In particular, we add two markers to the plot:</p>
<ol>
<li>A ✓ to indicate the model made a correct prediction of the next token,
based on this sequence position.</li>
<li>A highlighted horizontal bar, indicating the presence of the first two elements (trigram[0] and trigram[1]) of a trigram.</li>

<p>From the plot, we can see a few interesting things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Firstly, by default the head attends to the current sequence position. We can probably think of this as a &rsquo;no-op&rsquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly, most of the time when a trigram is present, the query key for <code>trigram[1]</code> will attend strongly (&gt;0.9) to <code>trigram[0]</code>. Less frequently, the head will split attention between <code>trigram[1]</code> and <code>trigram[0]</code> roughly evenly, and ignore everything else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thirdly, for some trigrams, the model makes a correct prediction of <code>trigram[2]</code> but only attends to <code>trigram[1]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the model occasionally makes correct predictions when no trigrams are present, which is just the result of a lucky guess.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Point one makes sense: the model doesn&rsquo;t need to know anything about the previous token if it is just going to make a guess (in the case of no trigram).
Point two also makes some sense: the residual stream for <code>trigram[1]</code> always contains information about <code>trigram[1]</code>. For the unembeddings or the MLP later on to make a correct guess, however, the residual stream also needs some information about <code>trigram[0]</code>, and the only way it can get this is by attending to the previous token.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s perhaps counter-intuitive is that sometimes the model makes correct predictions in the presence of a trigram without attending to <code>trigram[0]</code> at all!</p>
<p>To get a better understanding of what&rsquo;s going on, let&rsquo;s break apart the attention mechanism into position-based and token-based - that is, projecting the <code>W_pos</code> and <code>W_E</code> matrices into the attention space.</p>
<p>Below, we plot these two components for the tokens in each batch, all pre-softmax.</p>

<h1 id="initial-hypothesis">Initial Hypothesis<a href="#initial-hypothesis" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<h2 id="token-embeddings">Token Embeddings<a href="#token-embeddings" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The query vector is looking for a token that precedes it in a trigram.</p>
<p>E.g. for token 47, the query vector is looking for 2, 4, or 41 (because (2, 47, 28), (4, 47, 23), and (41, 47, 3) are all valid trigrams.)</p>
<p>The key vector indicates which token it represents. For token 41, the key vector says &ldquo;I am 41&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="positional-embeddings">Positional Embeddings<a href="#positional-embeddings" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>The positional embeddings are monotonic and essentially linear based on sequence position, with higher scores for later tokens. This means that the highest attention score is, by default, always the current token.</p>
<p>The positional embeddings for the last position of the sequence appears to be nonsense, because there is no correct prediction to learn.</p>
<h2 id="combined-embeddings">Combined Embeddings<a href="#combined-embeddings" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Combining the two embeddings, the algorithm for detecting trigrams appears to be:</p>
<pre><code>1. Use token embeddings to determine if a preceding token matches the current token. That is, increase attention when (key == trigram[0]) and (query == trigram[1]).

2. Use positional embeddings to mask out the attention scores for all keys except the immediately previous one.
</code></pre>
<p>This <em>could</em> explain how the model works for almost all trigrams.</p>
<p>The one notable exception to this are for trigrams with repeats, e.g. (72, 72, 48). In this case, the model appears to attend only to the most recent occurence of the token. Given what we suspect about how this model&rsquo;s attention mechanism works, we shouldn&rsquo;t really expect it to do anything else.</p>
<ul>
<li>The monotonic nature of the learned positional embeddings mean the most recent token always gets precedence</li>
<li>The token embeddings for two identical keys must, by definition, be identical</li>
<li>Because softmax is translation invariant, the model can&rsquo;t just make the token-based attention score very high in the case of duplicated sequences, because only the difference between the two positions&rsquo; attention scores matters.</li>
</ul>
<p>How, then, does the model predict these duplicate trigrams (and it does predict them correctly!)</p>
<p>Maybe the MLP directly implements predictions for repeated tokens? However, there&rsquo;s no mechanism for the MLP to get information about the previous token without an attention head playing ball and telling it the current token is a repeat. Since the positional embedding scheme in the single head present doesn&rsquo;t do that, there&rsquo;s really only one avenue left for the model to predict completions of duplicate-starting trigrams: fake it!</p>
<p>Since <code>trigram[0], trigram[1]</code> always imply the same <code>trigram[2]</code>, the model can always guess the correct completion, regardless of whether the current token is a duplicate.</p>
<p>Is this what we see?</p>

<li>For any sequence (that isn&rsquo;t a non-repeating trigram) ending in 72, the model always makes the same prediction. That is, it (weakly) predicts the correct continuation of the (72, 72, 48) trigram.</li>
<li>For another repeating trigram (54, 54, 67), we have the same behaviour: all sequences ending in 54 weakly predict 67 as the follow up.</li>
<li>Picking an arbitrary non-repeating trigram (in this case, (26, 49, 22)), we see that the model very strongly predicts the correct continuation (22). This is quite different to the two preceding plots, where the prediction was closer to uniform.</li>
<li>If we look at a number of non-trigram sequences, we can see that while predictions are fairly uniform, both sequence position and the preceding token appear to slightly tweak the exact distribution output. This is markedly different to the repeating trigrams (figures 1 and 2), which vary their predictions only based on sequence position and <em>not</em> on the preceding token.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the model is really using key-query vectors to encode <code>trigram[0], trigram[1]</code> pairs, we should be able to see that directly. Looking at the first 50 sequence positions:</p>

<p>Indeed, we can read off the values of our trigram-starting pairs by:</p>
<pre><code>1. Pick a value from the y-axis. This is the query token, and
represents `trigram[1]`.
2. Read from left to right, until we encounter a large value.
3. From this highlighted square, read off the x-axis value. This is the key value that the query was looking for - i.e. `trigram[0]`.
</code></pre>
<p>We can compare the hotspots on this chart to the set of possible trigrams, sorted by second element (<code>trigram[1]</code>). This gives quite good agreement, once we filter out very low values.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting is the significant variability in how intensely the model attends to different trigram pairs. It&rsquo;s possible this is a limitation of the space the model has to work with, or something else entirely.</p>

<h1 id="testing-our-working-model">Testing our working model<a href="#testing-our-working-model" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>So far, we have a strong working theory for how the model might work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the attention mechanism to encode <code>(trigram[0], trigram[1])</code> pairs. So long as <code>trigram[0]</code> and <code>trigram[1]</code> are different numbers, the model has two modes of operation. If a trigram is detected, the attention mechanism will move some information about <code>trigram[0]</code> (via the OV-circuit) into the residual stream. If a trigram is not detected, it will move information about <code>trigram[1]</code> into the residual stream (i.e. self-attend).</li>
<li>Based on the contents of the residual stream, predict the continuation. Theoretically this could be done purely with the unembeddings, although there will probably be practical constraints that prevent this and rely on the MLP.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can build this simplified model in code and see how well it predicts different trigrams (versus the actual model). Since we&rsquo;ll always predict trigrams, we&rsquo;ll fake the attention head by defining our own mid-model residual stream:</p>
$$
    x_\text{mid} = W_{OV}\:x_\text{trigram[0]} + x_\text{trigram[1]}
$$<p>Where $x_\text{trigram}$ is the combination of positional and token embeddings for the two tokens. (There are biases to consider, too, but I&rsquo;ve hidden them for simplicity in the above equation.)</p>

<p>We can see that our simplified model gets some predictions correct, but gets others wrong relative to the model - even with the full power of the mlp.</p>
<p>We can assess our simple model&rsquo;s accuracy against all the trigrams in the dataset. For every trigram the simple model fails to predict, we&rsquo;ll also print it&rsquo;s attention pattern (i.e. attention paid to (previous_token, current_token)).</p>

Simplified Model accuracy = 0.7906137184115524
Model accuracy: 0.9602888086642599
</code></pre>
<p>Evidently, our simplified attention pattern captures most - but not all - of the nuances of what the model has learned. The ~17% of failed predictions fall into two camps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attention is only paid to the current token. (This is the vast majority).</li>
<li>Some attention is paid to both the current and the previous token (this is quite rare.)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, we need to slightly extend our understanding of what attention does in the model:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attention detects <em>most</em> trigram pairs, and <em>typically</em> pays attention to the preceding token if it detects a trigram. Most of the time this is ~100% attention, but occasionally the split of (previous:current) is around 70:30.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the attention mechanism focuses on just the current token.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some trigrams are still succesfully predicted, even when the attention mechanism focuses 100% on the current token. For this to work, the model must encode a <code>trigram[1] -&gt; trigram[2]</code> map and always predict the same completion, regardless of if <code>trigram[0]</code> is present - that is, the same mechanism as used for repeated trigrams.</p>
<p>To verify this, lets take a trigram that doesn&rsquo;t excite the attention pattern out of its default state: (39, 12, 73):</p>

<p>Interestingly, in this case, the model fails to predict several trigrams (12, 12, 4), and (39, 12, 73) because it always predicts the completion for (64, 12, 34).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible this is an artefact of a phase-change in learned behaviour - the model might initially predict completions based only on the most recent token,
and only later in training learns to exploit attention to do a two-part prediction. If this is the case, perhaps some trigrams have not yet transitioned from the single-token prediction regime to the two-token regime.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also interesting that the model always predicts the completion for (64, 12, 34) - a sequence it could detect with attention - and not for (12, 12, 4), a sequence it could not detect because of the duplicate 12&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Other uses of this attention-free mechanism make some sense: (19, 52, 41) is never going to clash with another trigram, because 52 only appears as <code>trigram[1]</code> in this single example. Still, the prediction is less confident than it could otherwise be.</p>

<p>We have a fairly good grip on how the model detects trigrams. How, then, does it predict the continuation?</p>
<p>In a lot of cases, we might expect the model to be able to just pass the output of the attention head to the unembedding matrix, and predict the continuation from there. It seems likely, too, that the MLP will contribute to this process, but the exact split of MLP to direct logit attribution seems unclear.</p>

<p>We can try directly projecting $x_\text{mid}$ into the output space, like so:</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a great baseline, though. It&rsquo;s not like the MLP doesn&rsquo;t exist. We could try account for it by mean-ablating it, instead of zero-ablating it. We ignore the last sequence position, since that&rsquo;s pretty noisy, and take the mean over our (fairly large) dataset.</p>

<p>So is ~24.5% a fair accuracy score for how well the attention mechanism predicts tokens? Arguably, no.</p>
<p>To see why, let&rsquo;s rewrite the MLP contribution:</p>
$$
    \text{MLP}(x_\text{mid}) = A\:x_\text{mid} + b + \mathcal{N}(x_\text{mid})
$$<p><em>Where the MLP has been decomposed into a linear contribution $A x + b$ and a nonlinear contribution $\mathcal{N}$.</em></p>
<p>The motivation behind this split is that we understand well how linear systems work, and can see that a fixed linear transformation doesn&rsquo;t add extra &ldquo;logic&rdquo; to the model - instead, it moves information around, and always works the same way, regardless of what information it is moving.</p>
<p>Conceptually, especially without layer-norm, the linear contribution could be absorbed into surrounding matrices and biases such as $W_U$ and $b_U$. So, if we could calculate $A$ and $b$, we could get a better understanding of the attention head&rsquo;s predictive power without MLP intervention.</p>
<p>To do this, we can start by looking at the jacobian between the MLP&rsquo;s inputs and its outputs. For each token, the jacobian maps how much a given upstream vector contributes to a downstream vector.</p>
<p>That is, for an upstream vector x (such as $x_\text{mid}$) and a downstream vector y (such as $x_\text{post}$), the jacobian $J$ is defined as:</p>
$$
J = \left(\begin{matrix}
\frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_1} & ... & \frac{\partial y_1}{\partial x_n} \\
\frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_1} & ... & \frac{\partial y_2}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial y_n}{\partial x_1} & ... & \frac{\partial y_n}{\partial x_n} \\
\end{matrix}\right)
$$<p>For a nonlinear function like an MLP, $J$ needs to be recalculated for each input. Then, for each input, we have</p>
$$ y = J\:x + b $$<p><em>Where $b$ is a constant bias (independent of J) that we need to calculate.</em></p>
<p>While $J$ is a function of x ($J = J(x)$) for non-linear functions like our MLP,
we hope that we can find some situations where $J$ doesn&rsquo;t vary much, and can use that as the basis of our linearization.</p>

<p>Looking at the plot, there are some interesting observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MLP definitely appears to have a default behavior. Different tiles (with a few clear exceptions) look remarkably similar to one another</li>
<li>There are a few cases where the MLP behaves extremely differently. This turns out to be (generally) in cases where a trigram is present. These jacobians are orders of magnitude larger than the typical jacobians.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking more closely at a single &ldquo;default&rdquo; jacobian (in this case, batch=0, seq=0), we can actually make out some features:</p>

<ol>
<li>The MLP slightly erases a number of leading-diagonal terms. Given this, we should probably expect direct logit attribution of upstream vectors to perform worse than on a model trained without this MLP.</li>
<li>The MLP isn&rsquo;t just erasing data, it&rsquo;s <em>moving</em> data. There are some clear hotspots ((12, 2) in the jacobian, for example) that repeat amongst different sequence positions.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to remember that once we fix a jacobian (i.e. we <em>linearize the MLP</em>), the jacobian can no longer add extra information to the residual stream, and instead only moves it around.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s an appropriate jacobian to fix? We could try the mean:</p>

<p><img alt="png" src="output_46_1.png"></p>
<p>However, this is not an especially principled choice - when the MLP does activate, the jacobian is changed dramatically. Taking the mean includes the influence of these very large activations, even if we don&rsquo;t really want to.</p>
<p>Instead, we can try the median:</p>

<p>This looks a lot more like our <code>jacobian[0, 0]</code> (and other unactivated MLP jacobians)!</p>
<p>So, now that we have $J$, we just need to calculate our bias, $b$, since the MLP ignores constants. To do so, we rearrange the definition of the jacobian:</p>
$$
\begin{align}
y &= J x + b \\
b &= y - J x \\
  & = x_\text{post} - J x_\text{mid} \\
\end{align}
$$<p>Using similar justification to before, we pick the median bias:</p>

<p>Yes!!</p>
<p>By better accounting for the passive behaviour of the MLP, we go from ~25% accuracy to ~31% accuracy using only the attention mechanism&rsquo;s logic (since jac_median and bias are just frozen, linear transformations.)</p>
<p>In relative terms, we discovered ~25% more performance from the attention mechanism. It&rsquo;s still a long way from explaining the entirety of the model&rsquo;s performance, but it&rsquo;s a step.</p>
<h1 id="how-the-model-predicts-the-rest-of-the-tokens">How the model predicts the rest of the tokens<a href="#how-the-model-predicts-the-rest-of-the-tokens" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Given what we know about the rest of the model, we can hypothesize the following about the MLP:</p>
<ol>
<li>It reads from the stream written to by the OV circuit, as well as the current token stream.</li>
<li>It uses the results from these two streams to retrieve the correct completion. From this, it writes into the unembedding direction corresponding to this conclusion to boost the logits, and potentially even supresses other likely completions.</li>
</ol>
<p>An attempt to analyse the MLP using a sparse transcoder was used. In this case, a transcoder seemed like it could work well because we have clearly defined inputs (e.g. 16 in position 0, 43 in position 1 -&gt; predicts 68).</p>
<p>However, although a number of different attempts were made (varying transcoder widths, warm-up vs cold-start for learning rate and l1 penalty, varieties of learning rates, batch sizes, resampling frequencies etc.), no transcoders emerged that provided cleanly interpretable features.</p>
<p>It seems likely that good results could come from pursuing this further, but the results obtained in attempts thus far are uninteresting.</p>
<h2 id="one-last-trick">One last trick<a href="#one-last-trick" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>One trick we have left is to look at what subspaces the MLP reads in. The MLP has dimension 20, the model (residual stream) has dimension 32, and the attention head has dimension 16. This means that the MLP could fully read from the output space of the attention head, but cannot read the full token stream.</p>
<p>We can observe how it weights these two competing priorities based on the distance between subspaces. This isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to be meaningful for reasons I <a href="https://www.willsnell.com/posts/math_composition/">wrote about here</a>, but might still give us some idea.</p>

<p>So, the MLP pays very close attention to the first 4 dimensions output by the OV circuit, and then pays increasingly less attention. There&rsquo;s a sharp dropoff around the 9th dimension, which implies the MLP&rsquo;s focus is (very crudely) around 50% on the OV circuit and 50% on the current stream, assuming the residual stream has similar variance in all directions.</p>
<p>To verify this assumption, we can look at the residual stream directly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span>var_resid_mid <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> cache[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;blocks.0.hook_resid_mid&#39;</span>]<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>var(dim<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>[<span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">1</span>])

<p>So, while the residual stream is not equal in magnitude for all directions, everything is within an order of magnitude. For this very crude subspace measurement, it&rsquo;s probably close enough to uniform that we can use subspace angles to quantify how much focus the MLP is placing in different subspaces.</p>
