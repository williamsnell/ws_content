Information theory - and in particular, entropy - can be quite an intimidating topic.
It doesn't have to be. If you can develop some key intuitions for the topic, you can
learn and use entropy!

So let's dive right in... by playing the lottery!

Each round, you get to pick one number on the ticket below:

<div style="width: 100%; margin: auto; margin-bottom: -200px;">
    <object id="ticket" type="image/svg+xml" data="lottery_ticket.svg" height="500px"></object>
    <div id="ticket numbers" style="position: relative; top: -340px; left: 86px; 
        width: 202px; height: 182px; display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;"></div>
</div>

Once you've picked the number, you can get the results of 
the lottery on the machine below. 

There are two possible outcomes,
and so I only need to send you a single *bit* of information:

- 1, if your ticket is a winner,
- 0, otherwise

It's tiiiiiimmmmmme to play the lottery! Each press of the button below
will pick a **new random number**, and give you the results.

<object id="machine" type="image/svg+xml" data="lottery_machine.svg" style="margin-bottom: -80px"></object>
<script src="./lottery.js"></script>

Did you win? 

Chances are, you didn't. You can keep playing until you do, but be warned,
it might take a while.

It might seem like each time you played, I would send you the same amount of information. Either you won or you lost,
and both times you learned a single bit of information.

*But that's not the whole story.* To see why, let's modify the game slightly. This time,
I want you to tell me **the winning number** for each round. 
Is this possible? Most of the time - no. If your ticket lost, you can eliminate
1 of the 20 numbers, but there's still 19 to pick from!

**However**, if you **won**, you immediately know which number was picked. More 
than that, you also know all the 19 numbers that weren't picked!

The key intuition for understanding entropy is exactly this: the **more likely** a piece of information
is, the **less information** it carries. Formally, we define **Information Content**, sometimes called *surprisal*, as \(\frac{1}{P}\),
where \(P\) is the probability of the event happening. Actually, we need to take the *log* of this term 
to get the exact definition of Information Content:

\[
\begin{align}
            I(x) &= \log_2{\frac{1}{P(x)}} \\
                 &= -\log_2{P(x)}
\end{align}
\]

*Where \(P(x)\) is the probability of event \(x\) occuring, and \(I(x)\) is measured in bits (sometimes 
called Shannons in this context).*

#### Why do we need to take the log? 

Let's think about the lottery. If we had a winning ticket (with probability 
\(P = \frac{1}{20}\)), we only need to be sent a single bit to know that we won.
When we get that message, we immediately know twenty things:
- the 1 winning number
- the 19 numbers that did not win

If I wanted to just send you the winning number directly, and we were using binary, 
we'd need somewhere between 4 bits (\(2^4 = 16\))
and 5 bits (\(2^5 = 32\)) for me to specify which number has won. 

So why do we take the log? Because it takes the **number** of things we've learned, and 
converts it into the *bits of information* we'd need to represent that many things.

In our example, the information content of a winning ticket is:

\[
\begin{align}
        I(\text{win}) &= \log_2{\frac{1}{1/20}} \\
                      &\approx 4.322\;\text{bits}
\end{align}
\]

So in the winning case, I send you a 1-bit message, and with it you've learned about 4.32 bits 
of *information*.

### A Free Lunch?

This might seem too good to be true - greater than perfect compression of more than 4 bits of information
into a single bit message! Of course, this isn't the case.

The winning lottery ticket carries so much information **because** it is
so unlikely. Similarly, a losing lottery ticket tells us very little **because** it's such a common occurence.
If you can internalize this notion - rare messages carry more information - you can understand entropy
intuitively.

## Defining Entropy

We've talked about *information content* so far, but I promised to explain entropy. Fortunately,
the jump from information content to entropy is almost trivial. We can define entropy as

\[
        H(X) := \mathbb{E}[I(X)]
\]

\(\mathbb{E}\) is just the expected value - the mean - and \(I(X)\) is what we defined before, 
the information
content. So the entropy \(H(X)\) is simply the average amount of information contained in all the 
possible messages we could receive.

How do we calculate the average? After all, some messages are much more likely than others. Easy!
We just multiply the *information* of each message by the *likelihood* of receiving that message.

Let's calculate the entropy of the single-bit messages I send you, communicating
the results of the lottery:

\[
        H(\text{Lottery}) = P(\text{win}) I(\text{win}) + P(\text{lose}) I(\text{lose}) \\
\]

Remember from before, that:
\[
                    I(x)  = \log_2{\frac{1}{P(x)}} = -\log_2{P(x)} \\
\]

Therefore,
\[
H(\text{Lottery}) = -P(\text{win}) \log_2{P(\text{win})} \\
                    - P(\text{lose}) \log_2{P(\text{lose})}
\]

We know that \(P(\text{win}) = \frac{1}{20}\) and \(P(\text{lose}) = \frac{19}{20}\), so 
the entropy of the set of messages we could receive is:

\[
\begin{align}
            H(\text{Lottery}) &= -\frac{1}{20} \log_2\left(\frac{1}{20}\right) 
            -\frac{19}{20}\log_2\left(\frac{19}{20}\right) \\
                              &\approx 0.216... +\;0.070... \\
                              &\approx 0.286...
\end{align}
\]

There are a few key takeaways here:

1. We're receiving, on average, a lot less than 1 bit of information per message. 
Our communication scheme is wasting most of its bandwidth.
2. Roughly 75% of the entropy comes from the rare *win* message. The information
carried by each *lose* message is much, much lower.

Finally, let's introduce the standard formula for entropy. By now, it shouldn't be 
too intimidating. Remember, all it says is that entropy is the average information
content carried by a message.

\[
            H(X) := - \sum_{x\in X} p(x) \log_2 {p(x)}
\]

*Where \(x \in X\) just means all the messages \(x\) in the collection of messages that
could be transmitted, \(X\). In the lottery example, \(X = [0, 1]\).*

### Another Entropy Example

To really solidify the concept, lets look at a different binary channel. We can 
receive the message 0 or 1, like in the lottery. However, let's say that both
messages are equally likely: \(P(0) = P(1) = \frac{1}{2}\).

Then,

\[
\begin{align}
            H(X) &= -\left(\frac{1}{2}\log_2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\log_2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\right) \\
                 &= -\log_2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \\
                 &= \log_2 (2) \\
                 &= 1
\end{align}
\]

In other words, our 1-bit channel has an entropy of 1 bit *if* the two messages 0 and 1 are 
equally likely. If one message is more likely than another, our entropy would decrease, meaning
we would be transferring less useful information per bit.

Without proving this, we can show its consequences. Let's imagine our 1-bit channel now
only ever sends the message *1*. If you will always (as in *always* always) receive the same message, you can't
glean anything useful from it. The entropy of this situation would be 0.

## Consequences

What's interesting about entropy is that it says nothing about the *contents* of the message. In the lottery 
example, we could make the winning message a *0* and the losing message a *1*, and nothing would change. 
At no point does the actual message being sent factor into the calculation. Instead, all that matters
when calculating information content and entropy is *probability*.

This consequence also means that we are free to waste gratuitous amounts of information, if we want to,
based on how we *encode* our messages. For example, we could send the strings "WIN" and "LOSE", 
using 3 bytes (24 bits) and 4 bytes (32 bits) respectively. Our channel would still only have 
\(\approx 0.286\) bits of entropy, though.

#### Compression
For our exact case (communicating the results of a lottery), our 1-bit channel is actually optimal. 
We need to send something each time the lottery is drawn - otherwise, how would the receiver know
that they'd received the results? - and the smallest amount of information we can send is a single bit.

This encoding scheme is quite suboptimal for our other problem, though: if we want to know
what number was drawn, we'd have to receive up to 19 losing bits (or 1 winning bit) before we
were certain we knew the winning number. If we wanted to optimize our scheme for transmission of the winning 
number, we could use a 5 bit scheme *(or perhaps a variable-length 4 bit / 5 bit scheme)* to 
just transmit the number directly. But if our receiver is just going to compare the winning number
against the number on the ticket to see if we've won, we've wasted 3 or 4 bits.

This is an example of the [Pigeonhole principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle):
any time we losslessly compress messages on a channel, some kinds of messages get longer, and others get
shorter.

*(It's called the Pigeonhole principle because if you have **n** pigeonholes, you can't put **n+1** messages
in them without putting at least two messages in the same hole. [Pigeonholes are a kind of 
mailbox, although I like the idea of literal pigeons better.] In our case, if we only have 2 messages
and 20 possible winning numbers, 19 of our numbers end up in one kind of message, and only one ends up in the other.)*

# Practical Applications

Information Theory is widely used for analyzing all kind of communication. In his seminal paper -
[A Mathematical Theory of Communication](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf) -
Claude Shannon applied the ideas to telecommunication (at the time, the telegraph and the teletype were dominant), artificial
languages *(sequences of characters such as ABBDABCD)*,
as well as to communication in human languages like English. 

Like in our lottery example, real messages written in human language
have *much less entropy* than could theoretically be transmitted with the same set of symbols (for example, the English alphabet.)
We can think of this as *redundancy* - what fraction of the letters in a message could we delete 
before it lost its original meaning.

As Shannon wrote, 

> The redundancy of a language is related to the existence of crossword puzzles. If the redundancy is 
zero any sequence of letters is a reasonable text in the language and any two-dimensional array of letters
forms a crossword puzzle. If the redundancy is too high the language imposes too many constraints for large
crossword puzzles to be possible.

For this article, however, we will focus on *signal processing*. My claim is that entropy can be explained
visually, and that this visualization provides good intuitive insights. My hope is that
bringing the underlying geometry to the forefront will make it obvious what is going on.

To motivate what would otherwise 
be a very abstract journey, we will examine the function \(f\). Our goal is to try and determine 
whether f is related to \(X\) and \(Y\), using only
samples from \(X\), \(Y\), and \(f\).


\[
\begin{align}
            X &\sim \mathcal{U}(0, 40) \\
            Y &\sim \mathcal{U}(-25, 25) \\
            f &\sim \sin(X) \sin(Y)\;X\;Y + \mathcal{N}(0, 1)\\
\end{align}
\]

\(f\) is mostly a deterministic function of \(X\) and \(Y\), although there's a
sprinkling of gaussian noise (the \(\mathcal{N}(0, 1)\) term) for reasons
I'll explain later.


!!! TO DO: 
- 3d plot of x, y, f
- buttons that flip the view to \(f(X | Y)\) etc.

This function was chosen because:
- It's completely deterministic if you know \(X\) and \(Y\).
- It's decidedly non-linear. There are periodic functions, terms 
multiplied together, but not a linear term in sight. It's a mess!
- The underlying distributions are not just normally distributed. 
A lot of successful techniques assume underlying normal distributions,
but we want a technique that doesn't *require* those assumptions hold
to be accurate.
- It looks like a Christmas tree from one side and a bow-tie from the other.

I'm not completely joking with the last point - 
our human brain can *easily* tell that \(f\), \(X\), and \(Y\) are related. There's 
so much structure in the plot! So many patterns appear before us as we explore the 
space.

Despite this, many conventional data analysis techniques 

If we were to use linear analysis techniques - for example, the [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient) -
we would get results telling us that \(f\) is uncorrelated to \(X\) and \(Y\), because
the slopes of \(f\) against \(X\), \(Y\), or both are on average flat.

Similary, [Spearman's rank correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)
won't help us because \(f\) is not monotonic.

It's also important that our method distinguishes between the actual generating source (e.g. \(X\)) and
an identically distributed but independent source (e.g. \(Q \sim \mathcal{U}(0, 40)\)) which
just happens to share population statistics. Again, if we were to plot \(Q\) instead of \(X\) 


!!!TO DO: swap X with X[shift 1]!!!


, the
distinction is obvious. Looking at population statistics like the mean and variance of \(Q\) and \(X\),
however, would not distinguish between the two. Even some entropy measures - if poorly chosen - could
fail to separate the two distributions. The KL-divergences \(D_{KL}(f||Q)\) and \(D_{KL}(f||X)\), 
for example, should be equal to one another.


Note that we do not require our method to prove there is a **causal** relationship 
between \(f\), \(X\), and \(Y\). It can (and does) produce the same results whether
f is truly a function of \(X\) and \(Y\), or f is a function of some other variables
that happen to be (perfectly) correlated with \(X\) and \(Y\). If we think in terms
of how much information knowing \(X\) or \(Y\) tells us about \(f\), this distinction 
is irrelevant.

## Key Concept 1: Mutual Information

An information theory concept that seems quite promising is the [Mutual Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information),
\(I(X;Y)\). *(In our particular case, we might be interested in something like \(I(f;X)\), \(I(f;Y)\).)*

It describes how much information we learn about \(X\) if we know the value of \(Y\).

Mutual information has many definitions, some of which are given below:

\[
\begin{align}
    I(X;Y) &\equiv H(X) - H(X | Y) \\
           &\equiv H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y) \\
\end{align}
\]

The first definition says that Mutual Information is the entropy of \(X\) minus
the entropy of \(X | Y\). \(X | Y\) is the conditional entropy of X given Y. If that 
description means nothing to you, play around with the plot below. 

Conditional entropy has two helpful properties: 
1. \(H(Y|X) = 0\) if and only if knowing X tells us the exact value of Y.
2. \(H(Y|X) = H(Y)\) if and only if \(Y\) and \(X\) are independent random variables.

Visually, we can plot the conditional *distribution* \(Y|X\) and from it qualitatively
assess the entropy:
1. If \(H(Y|X) = 0\), the plot of \(Y|X\) will be a "thin" line, where each value of \(Y\)
maps exactly to a single value of \(X\).
2. If \(H(Y|X) = H(Y)\), the spread of \(Y\) is uniform across all \(X\). In other words,
we should get a cloud of points with constant density from left to right, and (potentially)
changing density as we go up or down.

!!!! Conditional Distribution Plot !!!!!

The second definition says that Mutual Information is the entropy of \(X\) plus 
the entropy of \(Y\) minus the entropy of \(X, Y\). \(X, Y\) is the *joint distribution*
of \(X\) and \(Y\), and can be visualized below.

!!!! Joint Distribution Plot !!!!!

The Joint Distribution



## Entropy for Continuous Numbers

Entropy as defined earlier is quite restrictive:
- We need to know all the possible messages that could be transmitted.
- We need to know the probabilities of receiving each possible message.

##### A Refresher on Continuous Probability Distributions
While some probability distributions are discrete - the outcomes of
rolling dice, or our lottery example before - a lot of situations call for 
continuous probability distributions. 

As an example, let's look at the normal distribution.
This is arguably the most useful distribution in statistics, and we'd
very much like to characterise its entropy.

<div id="normal distribution chart"></div>
<script>normal_chart("normal distribution chart");</script>

Remember, the plot above is the *probability density*, which we label \(p(x)\).
Points are more likely to be sampled from regions of high \(p(x)\) than from low
\(p(x)\). If we sampled 100 points from this distribution, we'd get a
distribution that looks like this:

<div id="normal samples chart"></div>
<script>normal_sample_chart("normal samples chart");</script>

We use the lowercase \(p(x)\) to denote probability *density*, which is 
different to probability for discrete events, \(P(X)\). With a probability
density (and continuous numbers), the likelihood of sampling 
at any exact value of \(x\) is zero. Instead, we integrate
across some range to get the likelihood of a sample falling in that *range*.

For example, with our normal distribution, the likelihood of a point being greater than the mean (\(\mu\))
is 50%.

Formally (for a normal distribution),

\[
    \int_\mu^\infty p(x) dx = 0.5
\]

Finally, the integral under the curve of \(p(x)\) from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\) must equal
exactly 1. That is, when we sample from the distribution, we have to get a point *somewhere*.

##### Making Things Discrete

We want a definition of entropy that works for continuous distributions. What we currently
have is a definition for discrete events:

\[
    H(X) = -\sum_{x \in X} P(x) \log_2{P(x)} \\
\]

From our definitions above, we know that we can use the integral of probability density \(p(x)\)
to calculate the likelihood of a point falling in some range (a, b). That is,

\[
    P(a \leq x \leq b) = \int_a^b p(x) dx       
\]
*Here we use the capital \(P\) on the left side because it is an actual probability.*

So, we can approximate a discrete distribution by dividing our continuous interval into
a number of *bins*, and calculating the probabilities of each bin. As we increase the number
of bins, we should get a better and better approximation of the *continous* entropy, whatever
that is. If we divide our domain into \(N\) bins, and the
width of each bin is \(\Delta x\), then we are going to calculate all the information content between
all \((x_i, x_i + \Delta x)\) for i from 0 to \(N\).

Writing this statement in maths, we are saying:

\[
\begin{align}
    H(X) &= -\sum_{x \in X} P(x) \log_2 P(x) \\
         &= -\sum_{i = 0}^{N} \left(\int_{x_i}^{x_i+\Delta x} p(x) dx\right)\:\log_2 \left(\int_{x_i}^{x_i + \Delta x} p(x) dx\right) \\
\end{align}
\]


Finally, instead of actually computing the exact integral, we can approximate it with a 
[Riemann sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum). A Reimann sum is quite simple: 
we draw a rectangle from 0 up to a point on the function, \(f(x)\). 
The area of this rectangle is \(f(x) \cdot \Delta x\), where
\(\Delta x\) is the width of the rectangle. 

As we make these rectangles narrower *(under some
conditions)*, our approximation to the integral should get better and better. In other words,
as our rectangle gets narrower (i.e. \(\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}\)), the area of each rectangle
approaches the integral:

\[
        \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}\int_{x}^{x + \Delta x} f(x)\:dx = \Delta x \cdot f(x)
\]

With all our tools assembled, we can now practically compute the entropy of our normal distribution.
Substituting in the Reimann approximation to the integral, we have:

\[
\begin{align}
    H(X) &= \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} -\sum_{i = 0}^{N} p(x_i) \Delta x\:\
    \log_2 p(x_i) \Delta x \\
\end{align}
\]

Play around with the chart below, where we carry out this exact procedure.. 
You should see that as we increase the number of bins, the area under the curve, \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) dx\),
rapidly converges to its true value of \(\approx 1\). This is just our earlier statement, that all of our
points must fall between \((-\infty, \infty)\). 

You might also notice that the entropy \(H(X)\) keeps increasing as bins get smaller. Worryingly, 
this value never converges - it just keeps increasing. If we take the limit of \(\Delta x \rightarrow 0\),
we'll have **infinite** entropy.

##### What Went Wrong?

This result isn't an issue with any of our assumptions. Instead, we can tease what's going on directly out of the maths.





## Key Concept 2: Entropy for Continuous Numbers

Entropy as defined earlier seems quite restrictive:
- We need to know all the possible messages that could be transmitted.
- We need to know the probabilities of receiving each possible message.

In our case, we're sampling from two uniform distributions and one normal distribution,
all of which give us continuous values in some range. By their very nature, there are infinitely
many numbers between, say, -25 and 25. How can we even define entropy? Well,
there are a few approaches:

1. Discretize our values. For example, our signal \(X\) isn't really continuous - if
it's represented as a 32-bit floating point number, it can't take on more than \(2^{32}\) 
different values. 
1. a) Artificially discretize our values. We can think of this as taking many similar 
values and putting them all in a single bucket. We might choose to have 50 buckets, or
50,000. A good representation of this is a [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram).
2. Modify our definition of entropy from a sum (over finite values) to an integral (over
infinitesimally small values).

Typically, we'll have to do some combination of both. Take our example of \(X, Y,\) and \(f\). 
If we only have samples of each and don't know the true underlying mathematical distributions,
we have to estimate. Often, we'll assume the distributions are continuous and work backwards 
to try and estimate a [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function).

But once we have a pdf, we still need a definition of entropy that works with continuous numbers.
Here's a sketch of how we get there. First, recall the definition of entropy as 

\[
        H(X) = -\sum_{x\in X} p(x) \log_2{p(x)}
\]

Second, remember that we can integrate our probability density function \(f(x)\) over some range (a, b)
to get the probability of our random sample falling within that range. That is,

\[
       p(a \leq x \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x) dx 
\]

So, we can start with a set of bins \((a_i, a_i + \Delta x)\) of some size \(\Delta x\), and treat each bin as if it
represents a discrete event with a discrete probability. We'll call the event \((a_i, a_i + \Delta x)\). Then,
the entropy is:

\[
        H(X) = -\sum_{(a_i, a_i+\Delta x) \in X} \int_{a_i}^{a_i + \Delta x} f(x)\:dx\;\log_2 \int_{a_i}^{a_i + \Delta x} f(x)\:dx
\]

Provide our \(\Delta x\) is small enough, we can use the [Riemann sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum) to 
approximate the integral of the pdf for each function. If you haven't seen this before, you might've seen 
the [trapezoidal rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule#Periodic_and_peak_functions),
which is quite similar. Essentially, we approximate the area under the curve using a bunch of rectangles or 
trapezoids. For the Riemann sum, we take some point \(x_i^*\) in our interval \((a_i, a_i + \Delta x)\) and
calculate the area of a rectangle of width \(\Delta x\) and height \(f(x_i^*) \). For simplicity, let's 
set \(x_i^*\) to \(a_i\):
 
\[

        \int_{a_i}^{a_i + \Delta x} f(x)\:dx \approx \Delta x \cdot f(a_i)
\]
!!!!! Area under curve = ..., True area = 1.0 !!!!!!!


In fact, under cert

Substituting in to our entropy formula,

\[
        H(X) = -\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \sum_{(a_i, a_i + \Delta x) \in X} \Delta x\
f(a_i)\log_2 \left( \Delta x \cdot f(a_i) \right)
\]

We can do some rearranging in our log, including exploiting the fact that \(\log(a\cdot b) = \log(a) + \log(b)\).

\[
\begin{align}
        H(X) &= -\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}\sum_{a_i \in X} \Delta x \
f(a_i) \left( \log_2 \Delta x + \log_2 f(a_i) \right) \\
\
        H(X) &= -\left(
\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \log_2 \Delta x \sum_{a_i \in X} \Delta x \
f(a_i)  \right) - \left( \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \sum_{a_i \in X} \Delta x\
f(a_i) \log_2 f(a_i)
\right)
\end{align}
\]

As \(\Delta x \rightarrow 0\), the width of our rectangles get smaller, but we also sum over more and more points.
If we assume some [conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral#Integrability) 
(e.g. our probability density function is smooth everywhere,) our approximation above becomes exact:

\[
        \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \Delta x \cdot f(a_i) = \int_{a_i}^{a_i + \Delta x} f(x)\:dx
\]

Since the integral of our probability density function across the domain of possible events \(X\) must equal 1,
we have 

\[
        \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \Delta x \cdot f(a_i) = \int_{a_i}^{a_i + \Delta x} f(x)\:dx = 1
\]

Also, summing all the integrals for each infinitesimal interval \((a_i, a_i + \Delta x) \) becomes 
equivalent to one big integral across all possible values - in this case, \((-\infty, \infty)\). 
So, the entropy is:

\[
    H(X) = -\log_2{\Delta x} -\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x) \log_2 f(x)\:dx
\]

The term on the right looks reasonable - if we swapped our \(f\)'s for \(p\)'s and our \(\int\) for a \(\sum\)
we'd have the discrete entropy we defined at the start. The issue is that \(\log_2{\Delta x}\) term. For truly 
continuous data, \(\Delta x \rightarrow 0\) and so \(\log_2{\Delta x} \rightarrow \infty \).

We can demonstrate this effect numerically, too. Let's sample lots of random points from a continuous distribution.
Then, we can divide space into a number of bins. The likelihood of a sample falling into each discrete bin is 
approximated as 

\[P(\text{bin}) \approx \frac{n_\text{bin}}{n_\text{total}}\]

*Where \(n_\text{bin}\) is the number of points in a given bin.*

As our bins get smaller and smaller, the likelihood of a sample falling into a given bin becomes 
increasingly unlikely. Consequently, the information content of each bin becomes larger and larger. In the limit,
where we are talking about truly continuous numbers, each bin is infinitely unlikely (but still possible), 
and therefore carries infinite information. 



!!!!! Plot of applying the histogram method !!!!!!

How to proceed? We could close our eyes and ignore the \(\log_2{0}\) term. This gives us the 
[Differential Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_entropy) \(h(X)\), which has many unfortunate
properties that make it much less useful than discrete entropy \(H(X)\) with a capital \(H\):

1. \(H(X) = 0\) implied there was only ever one message, and so we couldn't send any information. 
\(h(X) = 0\) does not have any special meaning. This is because:
2. Differential entropy can be negative. Finally,
3. If I have a random continuous distribution \(X\) and I pass it through an arbitrary invertible 
map *(read: a function)*, there's no guarantee it has the same entropy when it comes out. For example,
if I define \[Y = 10 X\] Measuring its differential entropy tells me that \[h(Y) = h(X) \cdot \log_2{10}\]
Despite producing exactly the same samples (just scaled up in magnitude by a factor of 10), the differential
entropy has apparently increased by \(\approx 3.32\) times.

What's going on here? It might be clearer if we think of the volume of some shape that could fit all the samples
of \(X\) inside it. That box would have a volume of \(V \approx 2^{h(X)}\). In other words, differential entropy 
is the (log) volume of the distribution. This explains why 
scaling up \(X\) by a factor of 10 increased the entropy. It also explains why differential entropy can
be 0, or negative: \(2^0 = 1\) is a valid volume, as is \(2^{-5.23}\). 

While this explanation is good for building intuition, it doesn't help us much practically. We want to follow
signals through functions, like \(f = \sin{X}\).

Fortunately, there's still hope. While outright ignoring the \(\log_2{0}\) term is fraught, we can cancel
it out in more legitimate ways. 

For example, if we had two different distributions over the same space, \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\), we could 
take the *difference* in information between the two distributions, and find the expected value.

\[
    \mathbb{E}\left[ \log_2 p(x) - \log_2 q(x) \right]
\]

Remember when we defined entropy, the expected value ended up just being the sum of \(p(x)\) times the information? 
To calculate the expected value here, we do a similar trick. We could use either \(p(x)\) or \(q(x)\),
since both sum to 1. It doesn't really matter which we pick, since we can just rename \(p(x)\) and \(q(x)\) if 
we want to swap them. Using \(p(x)\), our new measure is:

\[
\begin{align}
    D_{KL}(P || Q) &= \sum_{x \in X} p(x) \left( \log_2 p(x) - \log_2 q(x) \right) \\
                   &=  \sum_{x \in X} p(x) \log_2\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right)
\end{align}
\]

This is the [Kullback-Leibler divergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence),
and it has many nice properties.

One such property is that it doesn't blow up to infinity as we make our discretization finer. To see why,
let's try converting it from discrete form to continuous, like we did with the entropy above:

\[
\begin{align}
        D_{KL}(P || Q) &= -\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \sum_{(a_i, a_i + \Delta x) \in X} \Delta x\
p(a_i)\log_2 \left(\frac{\Delta x\:p(a_i)}{\Delta x\:q(a_i)} \right) \\
                       &= -\lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \sum_{(a_i, a_i + \Delta x) \in X} \Delta x\
p(a_i)\log_2 \left(\frac{p(a_i)}{q(a_i)} \right)\\
\end{align}
\]

We don't have to take this derivation all the way to see that the problematic \(\log{\Delta x}\) term has
disappeared - by looking at the *difference* between two distributions, we've cancelled out the infinity.

In the histogram plot, notice that as the bins get finer and finer:

1. The entropies \(H(X)\) and \(H(Y)\) get larger and larger
2. The KL-Divergence \(D_{KL}(X||Y)\) rapidly converges to a constant value.

The KL-divergence is the basis of most of the useful metrics that use continuous entropy. For it to work,
the *support* of \(p(x)\) must be enclosed by the support of \(q(x)\). In other words, for every \(x\) such
that \(q(x) = 0\), \(p(x)\) must also be 0. Otherwise, we'd have \[p(x) \log_2 \frac{p(x)}{0} \] Which ends up
being infinite. \(p(x)\) by itself being 0 is fine, though, because we can define \[0 \log 0 = 0\]

Estimating the KL-divergence from discrete samples also requires some care. In places where \(q(x) \approx 0\)
the KL-divergence can technically be valid, but might still not be computable, because we are very unlikely to
sample any points from \(q\) in this region. If we naively use a histogram method, we're quite likely to sample
\(p(x)\) in places where we have no \(q(x)\), and vice versa.

Take the mutual information, defined as:

\[
        I(X;Y) \equiv H(X) - H(X | Y)
\]
 





Even if the system we're analysing does send a discrete set of messages, it can often be difficult 
to estimate the chances of low-probability events. In our lottery example, with only two messages,
we could easily have received >20 *0* messages in a row. If we stopped sampling at that point, 
we'd wrongly conclude that there was only one message and the entropy was 0.


## Key Concept 3: Entropy Estimation

So far, we've seen a lot of visualisations. I keep coming back to the humble point-cloud - plotting a single
point for each sample, with an axis for \(X\), \(Y\), and \(f\) - because it presents all the data in the set 
at once with no simplifications.

One recurring motif is the idea of "thinness" increasing as entropy decreases - if we plot our signal against
one (or more) of the components that comprise it, we transform what was a fuzzy cloud into a
surface or membrane.

It turns out that some state-of-the-art methods for estimating entropy and mutual information calculate
exactly that - the "surfacey-ness" of a point cloud.
